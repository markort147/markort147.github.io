# About me

I'm a software developer with a background in [quantum information physics](https://www.quantumlab.it/) currently working as a Research Assistant at the [Brain Physics Lab](https://www.clinical-neuroscience.cam.ac.uk/research/traumatic-brain-injury-and-disorders-consciousness), University of Cambridge. I’m exploring ways to combine data analysis, code, and scientific research—especially in areas where
physiology and computation meet.

Before this, I worked as a backend software engineer in the [IT consultancy world](https://dsgroup.it), mainly focused on [Java](https://github.com/search?q=user%3Amarkort147+language%3Ajava&type=repositories), Spring Boot, Groovy, and a bit of everything from Bash scripting to SQL and JavaScript. These days, I’m still coding for fun—often in [Go](https://github.com/search?q=user%3Amarkort147+language%3Ago&type=repositories).

Lately I’ve been experimenting with [Docker](https://github.com/search?q=user%3Amarkort147+topic%3Adocker&type=repositories) and [HTMx](https://github.com/search?q=user%3Amarkort147+topic%3Ahtmx&type=repositories), trying out new ways to build and deploy lightweight tools.

I enjoy working on clean, maintainable systems and learning by building.
