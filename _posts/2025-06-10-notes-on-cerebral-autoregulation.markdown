# Cerebral Autoregulation - Study Notes

## The pieces of the puzzle

### Control of Cerebral Blood Flow

In order to work properly and healthy, the brain needs to be guaranteed a constant and sufficient income of nutrients and outcome of wastes and toxins, and is very sensitive to hyper and hypo-perfusion. 

Control of CBF involves a variety of physiological mechanisms that have individual and overlapping impacts. These mechanisms can be divided in four main categories:
- Autoregulation: response to changes in perfusion pressure (CPP).
- Chemoregulation: vascular response to changes in $CO_2$, $PO_2$ and $O_2$ content.
- Neuronal regulation: influence of nerves and neurons.
- Endothelium-dependent regulation: effects of endothelial cells on vascular tone.

> [!NOTE] Thoughts
> It is common to see other quantities being used as surrogates of CBF, for experimental needs. It's important to be aware that such surrogates rely on specific approximations and assumptions. For instance, it is reasonable and common to use blood flow velocity, when measured in vessels that are not directly involved in Cerebral Autoregulation - otherwise velocity and flow wouldn't be proportional.
### Autoregulation

Cerebral Autoregulation refers to the physiological mechanisms that aim to maintain constant and adequate the Cerebral Blood Flow in response to changes in cerebral perfusion pressure (CPP), that is the difference between the arterial blood pressure (ABP) and the intracranial pressure (ICP). 
#### First piece: Monro-Kellie Doctrine

Assuming a perfectly rigid skull, the Monro-Kellie doctrine states that there must be a dynamic equilibrium between its volumetric components, that are brain tissue, blood and cerebrospinal fluid:
\\[ \Delta V_{brain} + \Delta V_{blood} + \Delta V_{csf} = 0 \\]
This pretty reasonable law defines the dynamic binding between blood volume, that is strictly related to vessels volume, and intracranial pressure (ICP):
\\[
lower~blood~volume => higher~ICP
\\]
\\[
higher~blood~volume => lower~ICP
\\]
#### Second Piece: The Ohm-like Law

The most simple physiological model of CBF relates it to the difference between blood and intracranial pressure, called cerebral perfusion pressure, and the vascular resistance.
\\[
CBF = \frac{CPP}{CVR} = \frac{MAP-ICP}{CVR}
\\]
The model describes a sort of Ohm's Law, where the perfusion pressure is a tension and the blood flow a current. The CVR is inversely proportional to the fourth power of the vessels diameter. 

> [!note] Thoughts
> - Vessels are not reactive at timescales where ABP waveforms can be appreciated. Therefore, when this law is valid, MAP and ABP are de-facto the same thing.
> - Every terms of the law could be expanded as a function of MAP. CVR is a function of MAP, because vessels change their diameter in response to ABP changes. ICP is strictly related to blood volume, thus to vessels size, thus again to ABP. Therefore, there should be a way to express CBF as entirely and solely dependant on MAP.
