            <h3 id="control-of-cerebral-blood-flow">Control of Cerebral Blood Flow</h3>
            <p>In order to work properly and healthy, the brain needs to be guaranteed a constant and sufficient income
                of nutrients and outcome of wastes and toxins, and is very sensitive to hyper and hypo-perfusion. </p>
            <p>Control of CBF involves a variety of physiological mechanisms that have individual and overlapping
                impacts. These mechanisms can be divided in four main categories:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Autoregulation: response to changes in perfusion pressure (CPP).</li>
                <li>Chemoregulation: vascular response to changes in <span>CO<sub>2</sub></span>,
                    <span>PO<sub>2</sub></span> and <span>O<sub>2</sub></span> content.
                </li>
                <li>Neuronal regulation: influence of nerves and neurons.</li>
                <li>Endothelium-dependent regulation: effects of endothelial cells on vascular tone.</li>
            </ul>
            <div class="info-block">
                <strong><i class="fas fa-brain"></i></strong><br />
                It is common to see other quantities being used as surrogates of CBF, for experimental needs. It's
                important to be aware that such surrogates rely on specific approximations and assumptions. For
                instance, it is reasonable and common to use blood flow velocity, when measured in vessels that are
                not directly involved in Cerebral Autoregulation - otherwise velocity and flow wouldn't be
                proportional.

            <h3 id="autoregulation">Autoregulation</h3>
            <p>Cerebral Autoregulation refers to the physiological mechanisms that aim to maintain constant and adequate
                the Cerebral Blood Flow in response to changes in cerebral perfusion pressure (CPP), that is the
                difference between the arterial blood pressure (ABP) and the intracranial pressure (ICP). </p>
            <h4 id="first-piece-monro-kellie-doctrine">First piece: Monro-Kellie Doctrine</h4>
            <p>Assuming a perfectly rigid skull, the Monro-Kellie doctrine states that there must be a dynamic
                equilibrium between its volumetric components, that are brain tissue, blood and cerebrospinal
                fluid:
                \[ \Delta V_{brain} + \Delta V_{blood} + \Delta V_{csf} = 0 \]
                This pretty reasonable law defines the dynamic binding between blood volume, that is strictly related to
                vessels volume, and intracranial pressure (ICP):<br />
                $$<br />
                lower~blood~volume =&gt; higher~ICP<br />
                $$<br />
                $$<br />
                higher~blood~volume =&gt; lower~ICP<br />
                $$</p>
            <h4 id="second-piece-the-ohm-like-law">Second Piece: The Ohm-like Law</h4>
            <p>The most simple physiological model of CBF relates it to the difference between blood and intracranial
                pressure, called cerebral perfusion pressure, and the vascular resistance.<br />
                $$<br />
                CBF = \frac{CPP}{CVR} = \frac{MAP-ICP}{CVR}<br />
                $$<br />
                The model describes a sort of Ohm's Law, where the perfusion pressure is a tension and the blood flow a
                current. The CVR is inversely proportional to the fourth power of the vessels diameter. </p>

                <ul>
                    <li>Vessels are not reactive at timescales where ABP waveforms can be appreciated. Therefore, when
                        this law is valid, MAP and ABP are de-facto the same thing.</li>
                    <li>Every terms of the law could be expanded as a function of MAP. CVR is a function of MAP, because
                        vessels change their diameter in response to ABP changes. ICP is strictly related to blood
                        volume, thus to vessels size, thus again to ABP. Therefore, there should be a way to express CBF
                        as entirely and solely dependant on MAP.</li>
