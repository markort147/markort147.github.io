        I'm a software developer with a background in
        <a href="https://www.quantumlab.it/">
            quantum information physics
        </a>,
        currently working as a Research Assistant at the
        <a
            href="https://www.clinical-neuroscience.cam.ac.uk/research/traumatic-brain-injury-and-disorders-consciousness">
            Brain Physics Lab
        </a>
        , University of Cambridge.
        I’m exploring ways to combine data analysis, code, and scientific research—especially in areas where
        physiology and computation meet.

        Before this, I worked as a backend software engineer in the
        <a href="https://dsgroup.it">
            IT consultancy world
        </a>
        , mainly focused on
        <a href="https://github.com/search?q=user%3Amarkort147+language%3Ajava&type=repositories">
            Java
        </a>
        , Spring Boot, Groovy, and a bit of everything from Bash scripting to SQL and JavaScript.
        These days, I’m still coding for fun—often in
        <a href="https://github.com/search?q=user%3Amarkort147+language%3Ago&type=repositories">
            Go
        </a>
        — and staying active in the Go community.
    </p>

        Lately I’ve been experimenting with
        <a href="https://github.com/search?q=user%3Amarkort147+topic%3Adocker&type=repositories">
            Docker
        </a>
        and
        <a href="https://github.com/search?q=user%3Amarkort147+topic%3Ahtmx&type=repositories">
            HTMX
        </a>
        , trying out new ways to build and deploy lightweight tools.
        I enjoy working on clean, maintainable systems and learning by building.
